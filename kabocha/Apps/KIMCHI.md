### KIMCHI: An incentivised KSM:DOT prediction market

It’s not just a token. **It’s a bet**. 

A simple, clean, high-stakes call on whether Kusama (KSM) can close the gap on Polkadot (DOT), with usage incentivised through automated minting of KAB rewards.

If you’re tired of safe plays and ready to see KSM punch above its weight, welcome to KIMCHI. LFG.

### 1. **The KIMCHI Play**

The game here is simple: you’re betting that **KSM will close the gap with DOT**. 

If you think Kusama’s fast-and-loose attitude has what it takes to narrow in on Polkadot’s value, then KIMCHI is your token. 

There’s no final "win"—just a dynamic, ongoing race between the polished Polkadot and the edgy Kusama.

### 2. **Why KIMCHI Is Different**

KIMCHI thrives on the Kusama ethos: freedom, speed, and a community-driven approach that doesn’t fear risk. 

Similar to a prediction market, those who buy KIMCHI when they believe KSM will outperform DOT are rewarded as the ratio shifts in KSM’s favor. Conversely, if DOT outperforms, KIMCHI’s value decreases, penalizing those with incorrect predictions.

Unlike DOT’s brand image, KIMCHI leans into the chaos and creativity that comes when you realise there are no rules.

### 3. **KIMCHI Tokenomics**.

**KIMCHI tracks the relative performance of KSM against DOT.** Instead of reflecting KSM or DOT’s individual prices, DOTSAMA is pegged to the ratio of DOT/KSM. This approach allows holders to potentially profit if KSM gains on DOT, regardless of whether DOT and KSM are rising or falling in the overall market.

##### How it Works
- **Price Calculation**: The value of KIMCHI is based on the DOT/KSM ratio:
  - **When KSM gains against DOT** (the ratio decreases), KIMCHI’s value increases.
  - **When DOT gains against KSM** (the ratio increases), KIMCHI’s value decreases.
- **Supply Mechanism**: KIMCHI tokens are minted or burned in response to changes in the DOT/KSM ratio, ensuring that the token's price closely reflects the current ratio.

### 4. **Example Token Scenarios**

To make the concept clearer, here are some hypothetical price movements and how they would affect KIMCHI’s value:

1. **Scenario 1: KSM Gains Against DOT**
   - **Initial Prices**: DOT = $40, KSM = $4 (DOT/KSM = 10)
   - **New Prices**: DOT = $30, KSM = $6 (DOT/KSM = 5)
   - **Result**: KIMCHI’s price increases, as KSM has gained on DOT, even though both have decreased in absolute value.

2. **Scenario 2: DOT Gains Against KSM**
   - **Initial Prices**: DOT = $20, KSM = $2 (DOT/KSM = 10)
   - **New Prices**: DOT = $30, KSM = $2 (DOT/KSM = 15)
   - **Result**: KIMCHI’s price decreases, as DOT has gained against KSM, regardless of KSM’s stable price.

3. **Scenario 3: Both KSM and DOT Fall, but KSM Falls Less**
   - **Initial Prices**: DOT = $40, KSM = $5 (DOT/KSM = 8)
   - **New Prices**: DOT = $20, KSM = $3 (DOT/KSM = 6.67)
   - **Result**: KIMCHI’s price increases, as KSM has narrowed the gap against DOT even though both values have decreased.

### 6. **KAB incentive**

When users trade KIMCHI, they receive a small percentage in automatically minted KAB. This “cashback” reward incentivises frequent trading, promoting liquidity and volume in the ecosystem.

Kabocha is currently fully diluted and distributed but not available for trading on any exchanges. 

THe only way to receive KAB is through governance approval and/or automated minting functions for objective on-chain impact. 

### 6. **How KIMCHI Works as a Prediction Market**

KIMCHI lets you bet on KSM vs. DOT without waiting for a "final score." It’s like an endless horse race where Kusama is always the scrappy underdog. Think of it as a pulse check on market sentiment for KSM’s potential to disrupt DOT’s dominance.

**Trading strategies**:

KIMCHI can enable a blend of traditional relative value, sentiment-driven, and technical trading strategies, creating opportunities for a wide range of participants from retail traders to institutions.

#### **Arbitrage and Relative Value Trading**
   - **Ratio-Based Arbitrage**: Sophisticated traders could set up arbitrage strategies that take advantage of temporary mispricings in the DOT/KSM ratio across exchanges. For instance, if the KIMCHI price deviates from the true DOT/KSM ratio on different platforms, traders could buy KIMCHI on one exchange and sell it on another, profiting from the spread.
   - **Relative Strength Strategies**: Traders could focus on relative strength indicators, buying DOTSAMA when Kusama shows stronger price momentum relative to Polkadot and vice versa. This could involve technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Moving Averages tailored to the DOT/KSM pair.

#### **Sentiment and News-Based Trading**
   - **Event-Driven Trades**: News events—such as Polkadot governance updates, Kusama’s parachain developments, or ecosystem milestones—could impact the DOT/KSM ratio. Traders might take positions in KIMCHI based on anticipated reactions to these developments, profiting from price moves as market sentiment shifts.
   - **Social Sentiment Analysis**: Given the strong community base, traders could monitor social media platforms for sentiment trends among DOT and KSM supporters. Increased enthusiasm around Kusama’s updates or Polkadot’s regulatory news could drive quick trades on KIMCHI.

#### **Long-Term Fundamental Holds**
   - **Value Investing**: Long-term holders who believe in Kusama’s growth potential relative to Polkadot could take a “buy and hold” strategy, viewing KIMCHI as a way to continually benefit from KSM’s potential to close the gap. These investors would likely ignore short-term volatility, focusing instead on the broader economic and governance trends in Kusama’s ecosystem.
   - **Hedging Institutional Holdings**: Institutions or individuals with heavy exposure to either DOT or KSM might use KIMCHI to hedge against potential price movements in the opposite token. For example, a KSM-heavy portfolio could use KIMCHI as insurance if they anticipate DOT performing better in the near term.

#### **Technical Analysis and Volatility Trading**
   - **Mean Reversion and Bollinger Bands**: If KIMCHI shows patterns of reverting to a mean ratio, traders could apply Bollinger Bands to identify overbought or oversold conditions, buying when the ratio hits lower bands and selling when it hits upper bands.
   - **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: Given KIMCHI’s reliance on relative performance, HFT algorithms could capitalize on small price swings by monitoring and trading on minute-by-minute price differentials between DOT and KSM.

#### **Leveraged Bets and Options (future)**
   - **Leveraged DOTSAMA**: Some traders might look for leverage if they have a high conviction that KSM will gain on DOT quickly. A leveraged KIMCHI instrument would allow for amplified returns (and risks), especially attractive to traders with strong beliefs in a particular trend.
   - **Options for Hedging and Speculation**: If options on KIMCHI become available, traders could use calls or puts to hedge positions or make directional bets on volatility in the DOT/KSM relationship.
